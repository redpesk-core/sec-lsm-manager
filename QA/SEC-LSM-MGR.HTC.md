The component redpesk-core/sec-lsm-manager is here denoted as
SEC-LSM-MANAGER

This document list the tests ensuring that high level requirements
of SEC-LSM-MANAGER (@SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ) are fulfilled.

## Tests

### Service is installed

.TEST-CASE SEC-LSM-MGR.HTC-T-SER-INS

Check that the service is installed.

.TYPE integration

.REQUIRED-BY @SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-SYS-SER

.PROCEDURE

1. The command `systemctl status sec-lsm-manager` should show that the service
exists and is running.

### Service starts automatically

.TEST-CASE SEC-LSM-MGR.HTC-T-SER-STA-AUT

Check that the service starts automatically.

.TYPE integration

.REQUIRED-BY @SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-SYS-SER

.PRECONDITION

.PROCEDURE

1. The command `sec-lsm-manager-cmd log` must output `logging off` or
`logging on` instead of prompting `Connection refused`

### Service stops automatically

.TEST-CASE SEC-LSM-MGR.HTC-T-SER-STO-AUT

Check that the service automatically stops after the defined period.

.TYPE integration

.REQUIRED-BY @SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-SYS-SER

.PRECONDITION

.PROCEDURE

1. Check that *sec-lsm-manager* isn't running using `ps -e | grep sec-lsm-manager`
2. Activate the sec-lsm-manager using `sec-lsm-manager-cmd log`
3. Loop on checking that *sec-lsm-manager* is now running using
   `ps -e | grep sec-lsm-manager`
4. Note how long time it took to shutdown and check that it does not differ from
   the expected value with more than 5%
5. Another method is to invoke `time sec-lsm-managerd -k -S /tmp -s 10`
   and check that the reported real time is 10 seconds.

### Service socket is protected

.TEST-CASE SEC-LSM-MGR.HTC-T-SER-SOC-PRO

Check that the server socket can only be accessed by clients of the group sec-lsm-manager.

.TYPE integration

.REQUIRED-BY @SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-PRO-SOC

.PRECONDITION

.PROCEDURE

1. Check that the file `/run/sec-lsm-manager.socket`
   - is a socket file
   - is owned by the user `sec-lsm-manager`
   - is in the group `sec-lsm-manager`
   - is readable and writable by the user and the group
   - is neither readable nor writable nor executable by others

2. Check that a process not in the group `sec-lsm-manager` can't connect
   to the socket `/run/sec-lsm-manager.socket`. It can be done, by
   example, using the utility `socat` as in the the command:
   `echo sec-lsm-manager 1 |
    sudo -u guest socat stdio unix-client:/run/sec-lsm-manager.socket`

### Disconnect on protocol violation

.TEST-CASE SEC-LSM-MGR.HTC-T-DIS-PRO-VIO

disconnection.

.PRECONDITION

.PROCEDURE

   `socat stdio unix-client:/var/run/sec-lsm-manager.socket`
2. Enter `sec-lsm-manager 1`
3. Check it returns `done 1`
4. Enter `turlututu`
5. Check that the connection is closed and that socat gives up
   Before closing, the SEC-LSM-MANAGER can report `error invalid`

   for the commands from `id xx` to `uninstall`
3. Repeat the previous steps but replace the error generation `id x`
   with errors linked to an other setting: `path / x`, `permission x`,
   `plug / x /`.
