The component redpesk-core/sec-lsm-manager is here denoted as
SEC-LSM-MANAGER

## Overview

Here is a short introduction. For a more detailled overview
see the document @SEC-LSM-MGR.OVE.

The SEC-LSM-MANAGER is a server that allows its client, the application
manager to install and to remove the security policy of applications.

![Figure: use of SEC-LSM-MANAGER](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.OVE.fig-2.svg)

The SEC-LSM-MANAGER masters security policy by leveraging linux
kernel's LSM Smack or SELinux and by managing the permission database
cynagora.

## Requirements

SEC-LSM-MANAGER is a service helping installations and desinstallations.
For each client, it holds a context that records the properties already set.

### System service

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-SYS-SER

SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall start automatically when its protected activation
socket receives a connection. The process initiating the connection is
named *client* in this document. The SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall serve the client
and after a period of inactivity it shall stops.

**MOTIVATION**:
The SEC-LSM-MANAGER should not be invoked in command line but
should be integrated in the system configuration for running as service.

### Protected socket

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-PRO-SOC

SEC-LSM-MANAGER connection socket shall be protected in order to
allow connection only from authorized clients. The minimal
requirement is that the socket must be accessible only to processes
of the group *sec-lsm-manager*.

**MOTIVATION**
SEC-LSM-MANAGER is a sensitive service. It shall be accessible only
by authorities.

### Conformance to the protocol

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-CON-PRO

The server SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall implement the protocol described
in @SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO and shall strictly check that its clients are
respecting that protocol.

**MOTIVATION**:
The client gain service offered by SEC-LSM-MANAGER through
the correct use of the defined protocol.

### Installing security policy

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-INS-SEC-POL

The SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall, on client request, apply the security policy
corresponding to the current client context. On success, the client
context shall be cleared. On failure an error report is set to the client
and the context is not cleared.

**MOTIVATION**:
Installing security policy during installation is the main function of
SEC-LSM-MANAGER. The client shall first set all the properties in its
context and then apply it for installation.

Installation of security policy shall be done on existing files and
directories.
Installation of security policy has the effect to change
the access rules to the installed files or directories.
So it should be done at the end of the installation process.

### Atomicity of installation

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-ATO-INS

When an installation request fails, SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall revert any
effective change it made in the context of that request.

**MOTIVATION**:
The system shall not be changed if for some reason the installation failed.

### Removing security policy

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-REM-SEC-POL

The SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall, on client request, remove the security policy
corresponding to the current client context. On success, the client
context shall be cleared. On failure an error report is set to the client
and the context is not cleared.

**MOTIVATION**:
Removing security policy during removal of applications is needed.
It is needed for cleanning the database of permissions and access rights.
But it is also needed because some security policy can forbids the
removal of files by the installer. So requesting removal of security
policy shall be achieved before the real removal of files.

### Atomicity of removal

.REQUIREMENT SEC-LSM-MGR.HRQ-R-ATO-REM

When an removal request fails, SEC-LSM-MANAGER shall revert any
effective change it made in the context of that request.

**MOTIVATION**:
The system shall not be changed if for some reason the removal failed.
