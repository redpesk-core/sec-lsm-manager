The component redpesk-core/sec-lsm-manager is here denoted as
SEC-LSM-MANAGER.

The document @SEC-LSM-MGR.OVE describes SEC-LSM-MANAGER.

## The protocol

The SEC-LSM-MANAGER protocol normalizes exchanges between the
SEC-LSM-MANAGER, here named *the server*, and any process requiring
service of SEC-LSM-MANAGER, here named *the client*.

The protocol is *text line* oriented. Its implementation and description
are split in two layers following the OSI layering standard: presentation
and application.

The presentation layer decodes the received data to sets of fields,
hiding decoding details, providing one set for each received line.
Conversely it encodes sets of fields to data that can be transmitted,
hiding encoding details.

The application layer gives semantic meaning to received and emitted
set of keys.



## Presentation layer

### Encoding

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-ENC

The protocol is based on UTF8 encoded characters.
It is line oriented and each line is made of fields.

### Lines

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-LIN

A line is made of all the characters until the end-of-line character (LF) of
binary value 10.

### Fields

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-FIE

Within a line, the protocol distinguishes fields. The fields are separated by
exactly one space character (SPACE) of binary value 32.

```bnf
STREAM ::= [ LINE ]...

LINE ::= [ FIELD [ "SPACE" FIELD ]... ] "LF"
```

### Escaping

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-ESC

Because SPACE or LF could be present in fields, the protocol uses an
escaping character to hold it. The escaping character is the BACKSLASH
(`\`) of binary code 92. Each occurrence of characters SPACE or LF must
be escaped if present in fields. Escaping the character BACKSLASH (with
itself) is needed only if it is at the end of a field, or if it is
followed in the field by SPACE or LF. That is because when decoding
received bytes, if the character BACKSLASH is not followed by SPACE, LF
or BACKSLASH (itself), it is taken literally. Though paranoiac emitter
can safely escape every occurrences of BACKSLASH.

```bnf
FIELD ::= [ CHAR ]...

CHAR ::= "any character except SPACE, LF or BACKSLASH"
       | "BACKSLASH" [ "SPACE" | "LF" | "BACKSLASH" ]
```

Note that empty lines (lines without any field) and empty fields (fields
with no character) are possible and allowed.

These rules are summarized on the diagram below:

## Application layer

Basically, the SEC-LSM-MANAGER protocol is a sequential query/reply
protocol. It means that when connected, the client sends queries, and
for each query it gets a reply (in the query order). In practice, the
server processes completely each query before processing the next one.

### Structure of queries and replies

Each query matches one line of the transport and so one set of fields as
presented by the presentation layer. The first field of the field set
(line) is the key (**KEY**) of the query, the remaining fields are
the arguments (**ARG**).

For each query, there is one reply.

A reply is made of one or more field sets (lines). Similarly to queries,
the first field is a key of the reply. The two keys `done` (**DONE**)
and `error` (**ERROR**) are terminating the reply. The key `done`
indicates a success in the execution of the query; conversely, the key
`error` indicates a failure. All the preceding field sets (lines) are
keyed data sets (and it is obvious that none of it is keyed by **done**
or **error**).

This can be summarized by the figure:

![Figure: structure](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-structure.svg)

The last field set carries the status of the query. That status
can have associated values.

### No spontaneous data

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-NO-SPO-DAT

The server SEC-LSM-MANAGER never sends unsolicited data.
The server always send data in reply to a query.

### Protocol violation

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-PRO-VIO

A violation of the protocol occurs in the following cases:

- a received field is not valid UTF8;
- the query keyword is unknown;
- the number of parameters does not match the expected count;
- for a LOG request, if the argument is neither `on` nor `off`.

### Protocol violation report

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-PRO-VIO-REP

When a violation of the protocol is detected, the party detecting
the violation shall report it to its pair using the reply `error protocol`.

### Disconnection on protocol violation

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-DIS-PRO-VIO

After reporting a violation of the protocol, the party detecting the
violation shall disconnect unilaterally.

In other words, after sending `error protocol`, the connection shall be
closed.

### Client context

For each client, the SEC-LSM-MANAGER holds a client context.

At connection, the client context is empty (clear).

Depending on how they act on the context, the queries can be grouped
in 4 kinds:

1. HELLO:   negotiate the version of the protocol used for the context
2. INFO:    don't change the context
3. SETTING: change the context by setting properties
4. ACTION:  apply context for action or clear it

So, using these categories, a client interaction can be summarized by
the diagram below:

![Figure: protocol overview](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-app-overview.svg)

### Context erased on disconnection

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-CON-ERA-DIS

When the client disconnects, its context is dropped and cannot be
recovered in any way.

### Error state

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-ERR-STA

When a SETTING or an ACTION fails, noticed by returning an error status
in reply, the context shall enter in error state. When a context is in
error state, it refuses all new properties (SETTING) and all actions
(ACTION) except CLEAR. If a refused query is received, the reply is
`error not-recoverable`.

![Figure: state protocol](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-states.svg)

The dotted arrow indicates the HELLO query is optional (see
@SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-HEL-OPT below).

### Summary of queries

The protocol defines the below queries:

- **HELLO**: protocol version negotiation (HELLO)
- **LOG**: query or set the global log status of SEC-LSM-MANAGER (INFO)
- **DISPLAY**: list the current context properties (INFO)
- **ID**: set the application identifier (SETTING)
- **PATH**: add a path property (SETTING)
- **PERMISSION**: add a permission property (SETTING)
- **PLUG**: add a plug property (SETTING)
- **CLEAR**: reset the context, remove properties, clear error (ACTION)
- **INSTALL**: install security policy based on current properties
  (ACTION)
- **UNINSTALL**: remove security policy based on current properties
  (ACTION)

![Figure: queries](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-queries.svg)



### HELLO at connection

The HELLO query serves the purpose of negotiating a version of the
protocol.

Synopsis:

![Figure: HELLO](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-hello.svg)

The client offers a list of protocol versions it can use
(today version 1 only) in the preferred order. The server
answers `done` with the value of the acknowledged version it
will use. That value is in the list presented by the query.

#### HELLO shall be the first query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-HEL-SHA-BE-FIR-QUE

The HELLO query shall be the first query that the client emits. If the
client sends an HELLO query after another query, it is an error and a
protocol violation.

#### Server returns the version to use

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-SER-RET-VER-USE

The server scans in order the versions offered by the client and chooses
to use the first version it supports. The reply value is that chosen
version.

#### Disconnection if unsupported versions

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-DIS-IF-UNS-VER

If none of the offered protocol versions is supported, the server
replies *error protocol* and disconnects.

In other words, unsupported versions in HELLO are treated as protocol
violations.

#### HELLO is optional

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-HEL-OPT

Negotiating the protocol version at connection is optional. When no
HELLO announcement is made, the default version of the protocol is the
latest available version: 1. That is because the protocol is intended be
backwards compatible.

### LOG: Getting and setting logging

The query LOG is administrative. It can be used to enforce the
SEC-LSM-MANAGER to log all traffic. This might be useful for
debugging or for auditing.

That query never fail.

Synopsis:

![Figure: LOG](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-log.svg)

This query doesn't change the context of the client but it can
change the global state of the SEC-LSM-MANAGER server.

Without an argument, it simply queries the current state of logging.

With an argument, it sets on or off the logging.

In all cases, it returns the final state of logging.

#### Valid LOG query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-LOG-QUE

A valid LOG query has either no argument or exactly
one argument that is either `on` or `off`.

#### Valid LOG reply

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-LOG-REP

A LOG query never fails and the reply always have one value that
is either `on` if logging is currently on or `off` if logging is
currently off.



### DISPLAY: Listing the context

The DISPLAY query sends to the client its current context. That behavior
can be used for debugging and for reporting messages on failure.

Synopsis:

![Figure: DISPLAY](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-display.svg)

Received data is keyed with `string`, then the following fields match
the received queries except for `error`.

The error status is only sent when the context is in error state.

#### Valid DISPLAY query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-DIS-QUE

A valid DISPLAY query has no argument.

#### Valid DISPLAY reply

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-DIS-REP

A DISPLAY query should not fail but since it can encounter network
issues while displaying the properties, it can report an error.

The reply to a DISPLAY query is made of as many field sets (lines) as
needed, all of them having the key `string` with values except the last
one that has the key `done` without value.

The valid values following the key `string` are:

- queries of previously set properties except CLEAR (i.e. the queries
  ID, PATH, PERMISSION and PLUG)

- the values `error on` if and only if the context has entered
  in error state and needs a CLEAR

In case of an error while displaying properties, the server replies
`error internal` and enters in error state.

### ID: Setting the application identifier

The ID query sets the identifier of the application in the current
client context.

Synopsis:

![Figure: ID](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-id.svg)

Set the ID of the application in the context.

Setting the application identifier is not mandatory. Some properties may
not require it. For version 1 of the protocol, only the *path* property
with the *default* type does not require an identifier.

The figure below shows that rule for installation/uninstallation.

![Figure: state according to ID](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-install-states.svg)

#### Valid ID query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-ID-QUE

A valid ID query has one argument, the identifier of the application
that must be valid.

#### Valid application identifier

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-APP-IDE

A valid application identifier must match the following regular
expression:

```regex
[-_a-zA-Z0-9]{2,200}
```

#### Query ID only once

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-QUE-ID-ONL-ONC

It is an error to send an ID query to set the application identifier if
it has already been set.

#### Valid ID reply

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-ID-REP

On success, an ID reply has no value.

On error, an ID reply has one of the following error indicators and
enters in error state:

- invalid: the identifier is invalid.
- already-set: the identifier is already set in the context.
- not-recoverable: the context is in error state.
- internal: internal server error.

### PATH: Adding a path

The PATH query adds a path property telling the expected security type
of an item in the filesystem (file, link or directory).

Synopsis:

![Figure: PATH](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-path.svg)

Adds the file system entry of PATH with the given PATH-TYPE in the
context.

#### Valid PATH query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PAT-QUE

A valid PATH query has 2 arguments, the path, *PATH*, to the entry in the filesystem
and its type, *PATH-TYPE*.

#### Validity of the path

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PAT

A valid path matches the 3 below criterions:

1. its length is not bigger than 1024 bytes;
2. it is absolute (starts with a slash);
3. it points to an existing entry in the filesystem.

#### Validity of the path type

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PAT-TYP

The valid values for PATH-TYPE are:

- **default**: System wide default access. No write access is allowed but files
  can be read and executed.
- **conf**: Configuration file of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read only mode. Other applications are not allowed to access it.
- **data**: Data file of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read only mode. Other applications are not allowed to access it.
- **exec**: Executable file of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read only mode and can execute it. Other applications are not
  allowed to access it.
- **http**: Served file of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read only mode. Other applications are not allowed to access it.
- **icon**: Icon file of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read only mode. Other applications are not allowed to access it.
- **id**: Root directory of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read/write/execute mode.  Other applications are not
  allowed to access it.
- **lib**: Library file of a managed application. The application can
  access it in read only mode and can execute it. Other applications are not
  allowed to access it.
- **plug**: Exported directory of a managed application. The content of this
  directory is exported to some selected other applications that can access
  its content.
- **public**: Public file of a managed application. Any application can access
  it for read/write/execute.

#### Only once per path

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-ONL-ONC-PER-PAT

The path property of a given path shall be set only one time. Trying to
set the path property twice for the same path shall lead to an error.

#### Valid PATH reply

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PAT-REP

On success, a PATH reply has no value.

On error, a PATH reply has one of the below error indicator
and enters in error state:

- invalid: the path or its path-type is invalid.
- already-set: that path is already set in the context.
- not-found: the path doesn't exist.
- no-access: the path can't be accessed.
- not-recoverable: the context has been in error state.
- internal: internal server error.



### PERMISSION: Adding a permission

The PERMISSION query adds a permission property telling to grant a
permission to the application.

Synopsis:

![Figure: PERMISSION](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-permission.svg)

Adds the PERMISSION in the context.

#### Valid PERMISSION query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PER-QUE

A valid PERMISSION query has one argument, the permission, that must be
valid.

#### Valid application permission

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-APP-PER

A valid permission is a string of at least 2 bytes and at most 1024 bytes.

#### Query PERMISSION only once

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-QUE-PER-ONL-ONC

It is an error to send a PERMISSION query for a permission which has
already been set.

#### Valid PERMISSION reply

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PER-REP

On success, a PERMISSION reply has no value.

On error, a PERMISSION reply has one of the following error indicator
and enters in error state:

- invalid: the permission is invalid.
- already-set: that permission is already set in the context.
- not-recoverable: the context is in error state.
- internal: internal server error.



### PLUG: Adding a plug

The PLUG query adds a property telling to plug an exported directory in
an importing directory and to allow the access to the exported directory
content to an application.

Synopsis:

![Figure: PLUG](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-plug.svg)

Plugs the directory of path EXPORTED in the directory of path IMPORT
and gives access to its content to the application of APPID.

Note that the application APPID should have access to the IMPORT
directory.

#### Valid PLUG query

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PLU-QUE

A valid PLUG query has 3 arguments:

1. the path of the exported directory to plug.
2. the identifier of the application allowed to access the plugged
   directory, shall be a valid application identifier.
3. the path of the importation directory.

#### Validity of directories

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-DIR

The EXPORTED and IMPORT entries must exist exist in the filesystem, must
be directories and the size of each path not bigger than 1024 bytes.

#### Only once per import directory

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-ONL-ONC-PER-IMP-DIR

The IMPORT directory shall be set only once. Trying to set the plug
property leads to an error if a plug property already exists with the
same IMPORT path.

#### Valid PLUG reply

.RULE SEC-LSM-MGR.PRO-U-VAL-PLU-REP

On success, a PLUG reply has no value.

On error, a PLUG reply has one of the following error indicators and
enters in error state:

- invalid: an argument is invalid.
- already-set: that IMPORT already has a plug in the context.
- not-found: one of the directories doesn't exist.
- no-access: one of the directories can't be accessed.
- not-dir: one of the paths is not a directory.
- not-recoverable: the context has been in error state.
- internal: internal server error.



### CLEAR: Resetting the context

The query CLEAR removes all properties from the context and clears the
error state.

That query never fails.

Synopsis:

![Figure: CLEAR](assets/SEC-LSM-MGR.fig-protocol-clear.svg)

The client asks SEC-LSM-MANAGER to reset the state of the context to its
original state as if connection just occurred.

#### Valid CLEAR query
